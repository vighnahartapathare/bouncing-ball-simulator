This project is a simple yet interactive simulation of a bouncing ball built with **Pygame**. It features physics like gravity and damping, wall collisions, and intuitive mouse controls for dragging and throwing the ball. The simulation runs in fullscreen mode and dynamically adapts to your screen resolution.
